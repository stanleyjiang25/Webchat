# Installation Instructions

## Introduction

After unzipping our project, drill down (using the `cd` command) so you are in the "WebChat" directory. The "WebChat" directory should be in the same parent directory as this installation file.


## Installing Ocaml 4.13.1

Our project requires you to have Ocaml version 4.13.1. You likely do not have this installed (none of us did), but to check you can run in your terminal:

`ocaml -version`

To install Ocaml version 4.13.1, run the following commands in your terminal (even if you are on version 4.13.1, we suggest you run this anyway):

`opam switch create 4.13.1`

`eval $(opam env)`

The first command will likely take a while to complete since it is reinstalling a new version of Ocaml. After these both have succesfully run, check your Ocaml version again to make sure it has updated correctly:

`ocaml -version`


## Installing Ocaml Libraries

Since you likely just updated your version of Ocaml, you should reinstall all the relevant libraries that are necessary for our app:

`opam install dune`

`opam install ounit2`

`opam install opium`

`opam install caqti`

`opam install caqti-lwt`

`opam install caqti-driver-postgresql`

Some of these installations may ask for your permission or ask a y/n question. Just enter "y" and continue with the installation.

With Ocaml 4.13.1 and these libraries installed, you should be ready to run our app!


## Install Postgresql

But first...you need to install postgresql through your terminal. This will be shown from a MacOS perspective, though some steps are similar to the Ubuntu installation. First, check that you have Homebrew, which will be used to install Postgresql. In your terminal, run:

`brew`

If a series of brew services pops up, you have completed this step. If not, please refer to this installation guide to install Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
Also, it would be helpful to update it: `brew update`
Now that we are able to finally move forward, run this simple command to install Postgres:

`brew install postgresql`

Installation might make a while. But once it has been downloaded successfully, we must actually access the datbase system. To do this, run:

`brew services start postgresql`

Great, now the service is running. But we would like to configure it for our use. So we will sign in as the root user which gives us access to admin privileges. In order to do so, run:

`psql postgres`

Welcome to the psql terminal, where PGSQL commands are only allowed. Here, you will make your own user, so input:

`CREATE ROLE <your username> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';`

Where it says <your username>, enter the specfic username that is used in your normal terminal. For the password, make sure that it is just 'password', just for simplicity reasons. You have now created a user. While still in the psql terminal, you will make a database for your new user. Run:

`CREATE DATABASE <your username>`

To check if you did this correctly, do `\l`, which looks at all registered databases. If you see your username in the table, you did everything correctly! Now it is time to run our web app.

(Don't do this right now, but after running our app, it is helps to stop postgres when you do not use it anymore. When you want to stop it, enter: `brew services stop postgresql`)
  

# Run Instructions

## Running the App

To run the app, first be sure that you are still in the "WebChat" directory, and then run the following in your terminal:

`dune build`

`make run`

If you get a "Fatal error" after running this last command, it may be because the 3000 port of your localhost is currently in use. If this is the case, you need to find the PID of the process that is running on port 3000 and kill it. [This forum](https://superuser.com/questions/1411293/how-to-kill-a-localhost8080) gives a good outline on how to do this depending on your OS (just replace all instances of "8080" with "3000").

## Accessing the App

The server should now be running. Requests can be made to http://localhost:3000 and the frontend of the app can be found by visiting http://localhost:3000/index.html in a web browser. The app can be also be accessed (and requests can be made) by visiting http://[_YOUR NETWORK IP_]:3000/index.html on any device connected to the same network your computer is connected to. Finding out your network IP varies with OS, but a simple google search should tell you how to find it.

## Cleaning the App

Even if you terminate the command by typing `^c` (ctrl-c), the app will still be running because the server is technically never closed. Now, if you try to run the `make run` command again, you will get a "Fatal error" (even though the app will still be running). To circumvent this and clear the 3000 port of your localhost, run `make clean` in your terminal. If this does not work (one person in our group using Ubuntu was having this problem), instead just manually run the following command in your terminal:

`pkill -f _build/default/ocaml_webapp/bin/main.exe`

If this command gives an error, it likely means that port 3000 of your localhost is actually not currently being used and any problems with running `make run` may be due to other errors.
